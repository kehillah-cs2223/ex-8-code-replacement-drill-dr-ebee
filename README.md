***tl;dr replace code with a comment, then re-write code from the comment (make commits each step)***

Practice taking code that's difficult to understand and breaking it down into small pieces

**Goal:** Improve ability to **interpret** and **generate** code

## What to do?

1. Find some existing, *working* code.

    * You can pick *one* of the examples in this repo if you want, OR...
    * You can choose code you've written before for a different exercise, OR...
    * You can search on github.com for something you're interested in and fork their repository

2. For each line in the code:

    a) Write a comment above the line that describes what it does.
    
    b) Delete the line of code that you made a comment for. **(Only delete one line at a time!)**
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has the comment, and doesn't have the code
                                         Commit message can be "comment"
          
    c) Below the comment you made, write code that does that job.

    d) Check that your new version of the program still runs the same way as the original.
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has both the comment and the code
                                         Commit message can be "code"
                                         
3. Break the code into larger "chunks". For each chunk of code:

    a) Write a comment above the chunk of code that describes what it does.
    
    b) Delete the chunk of code that you made a comment for. **(Only delete one chunk of code at a time!)**
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has the comment, and doesn't have the code
                                         Commit message can be "comment"
          
    c) Below the comment you made, write code that does that job.

    d) Check that your new version of the program still runs the same way as the original.
    
        → For turning in the assignment: Make a commit that has both the comment and the code
                                         Commit message can be "code"
                                         
4. Keep increasing the size of the chunks of code until you are commenting and re-writing the code for the entire program.
